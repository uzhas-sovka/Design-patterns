The initial idea to translate book code to C# turned out to be ineffective: the attention focus moved to the flood of MSVS hints and tips, so I decided to install IntelliJ. No wonder direct copy-pasting from the book worked fine.
The authors' sequence of material should be reversed because nothing compiles without Pizza abstract class.
